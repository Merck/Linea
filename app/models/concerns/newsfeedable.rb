# This meta programing marvel ensures that any activity that includes this module
# automatically puts a record into the newsfeed table when its created
# and deletes its record in the newsfeed table if the activity is destroy.
#
# It will also make sure that the relations are created between the newsfeed item and the activity.
#
# It very dynamic and only requires a "class_name_id" column in the newsfeed item
# table - and a belongs_to relation in the NewsfeedItem class to work.
